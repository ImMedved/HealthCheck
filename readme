# HealthCheck Project

---

The HealthCheck project is a comprehensive server monitoring system designed to provide real-time insights into the availability and performance of servers. Developed as part of a school graduation project, the system allows users to monitor multiple servers simultaneously and receive notifications about any detected issues.

## Technologies Used

- Java: The core programming language used for backend development.
- Spring Boot: Provides a robust framework for building and deploying Java-based applications.
- Hibernate: Object-relational mapping (ORM) tool for interacting with the database.
- PostgreSQL: Database management system for storing server and error data.
- Spring Data JPA: Simplifies data access layer implementation with JPA.
- Thymeleaf: Server-side Java template engine for dynamic web content generation.
- HTML/CSS: Frontend technologies for designing the user interface.
- Maven: Dependency management tool for Java projects.

## Key Classes and Responsibilities

- ServerEntity: Represents a server entity in the database, storing information such as server name, URL, and current status.

- ErrorEntity: Stores error logs related to server monitoring, including error timestamps and associated server IDs.

- ServerController: Handles HTTP requests related to server management, such as adding new servers and retrieving server information.

- ErrorController: Manages error-related HTTP requests, including logging errors and retrieving error logs.

- ServerService: Provides business logic for server-related operations, such as adding servers and updating server status.

- ErrorService: Implements error handling logic, including error logging and retrieval.

- AppConfig Configuration class responsible for configuring beans, including the RestTemplate bean for making HTTP requests.

## Usage

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
- Configure the database connection details in the application.properties file.
- Build and run the application.
- Access the web interface to monitor servers and view error logs.
